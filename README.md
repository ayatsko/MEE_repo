This repository contains the data and R code to reproduce all analyses of our paper entitled "Modelling internal stem damage in savanna trees: error in aboveground biomass with terrestrial laser scanning and allometry". The paper quantifies how internal stem damage varies throughout trees and tests its effect on aboveground biomass estimation using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and allometric scaling models (ASMs). 

All code is inside the R directory.
